							Different views for different experiences

							It has always been an expectation in my work to handle page layout across all viewport sizes.
						</p>
						<p>
							In some cases, the design calls for information to be displayed differently based on the viewport.
							In the associated examples, I made a user interface that does just that.
						</p>

							The mobile user is given an option to click <code>READ MORE</code> to show more text content

							a user has several filters that can be applied to see a list of departing
							and arriving flights.

							Orox Leather Branded Website

							As a front end engineer, I am usually given a design to implement.

							in Portland, Oregon.
							They sell unique, fine leather products and needed their Shopify
