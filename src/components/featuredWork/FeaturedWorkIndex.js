							Orox Leather Branded Website

						<p>
							As a front end engineer, it is my job to bring a given design
							to life on a webpage.
							It is up to me to write the code in a way that is
							simple to extend and change while keeping a consistent
							experience of the visual design. The solidity of a front end
							implementation becomes apparent as the site is used on different machines
							and over time as content changes.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my early career, I especially enjoyed styling the
							<a
								href='https://www.oroxleather.com/'
								target='_blank'
								className='space-around'
							>
								Orox Leather
							</a>
							website.
							Orox sells unique, fine leather products and needed a website
							to reflect their unique and special style. I made changes to the
							existing Shopify theme to match their requested design updates,
							making sure my updates would last a long time by writing
							clean, consistent, and intelligently designed CSS.

							Different views for different device experiences
						</b>
						<p>
							It is an expectation in my work to handle page
							layout across all viewport sizes.
							In some cases, the design calls for elements of the webpage to be displayed
							differently based on the viewport.
							For example, when implementing a modal for users to "rate a comment",
							the user interface needed to behave very different between mobile
							and desktop views.
						</p>
						<p>
							The mobile user is given an option to click <code>READ MORE</code> to
							show more text content beneath the article title and username, and by
							default is only shown the headlines.
						</p>
						<p>
							The desktop view, in contrast, shows a snippet of the text content
							beneath the titles by default, and the <code>READ MORE</code> button
							is conditionally shown when then text content exceeds a maximum snippet amouunt.

							Airport Departures and Arrivals Page
						</b>
						<p>
							React elements are cheap to create and can be used to render items
							expected to re-render on a webpage such as
							a list of results. On the FlightStats Departures and Arrivals page,
							the rows of the results table are all React components that render
							with basic styling depending on information about the flight status.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the departures and arrivals page,
							several filters can be applied to see a list of relevant departing
							and arriving flights.
							The experience of seeing an instantly updated results list of
							flight statuses and airport statistics based on filters
							prevents information overload for users. Not waiting for a
							reload builds user confidence, and is possible by triggering a
							simple and cheap re-render of the results when a filter is applied.
