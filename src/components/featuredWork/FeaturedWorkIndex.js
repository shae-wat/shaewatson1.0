							Orox Leather Branded Website

						<p>
							As a front end engineer, I am usually given a design to implement.
							It is then up to me to format the code implementation in a way that is
							simple to extend and change while keeping a consistent
							experience of the visual design. The solidity of a front end
							implementation becomes apparent as the site is used on different machines
							and over time as content changes.
						</p>
						<p>
							In my early career, I especially enjoyed styling the
							<a
								href='https://www.oroxleather.com/'
								target='_blank'
								className='space-around'
							>
								Orox Leather
							</a>
							website.
							Orox sells unique, fine leather products and needed a Shopify
							theme to reflect their unique and special style. I made changes to the
							existing theme to match their requested design updates,
							making sure my updates would last a long time by writing
							clean, consistent, and intelligently designed CSS.

							In the "Rate Comment" examples, I made a user interface that does just that.

							Airport Departures and Arrivals Page
						</b>
						<p>
							React elements are cheap to create and can be used to render items
							expected to re-render on a webpage such as
							a list of results. On the FlightStats Departures and Arrivals page,
							the rows of the results table are all React components that render
							with different colors depending on the flight status.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the departures and arrivals page,
							several filters can be applied to see a list of relevant departing
							and arriving flights.
							The experience of seeing an instantly updated results list of
							flight statuses and airport statistics based on filters
							prevents information overload for users. Not waiting for a
							reload builds user confidence, and is possible by triggering a
							simple and cheap reload of the results on filter selection.
